# On The Day

### Introduction

This repository will serve as a hub for resources you may utilise for this hackathon. We will be uploading useful tutorials if you want to get started on you projects and any project's you finish at the end of the hackathon can be uploaded here to the repository for your *Show & Tell*! :smiley:

As well as this, this repository will always be here after the hackathon with resources if you want to explore further.

### Hackathon activities

During the hackathon, there will small activities to take part in i.e. cup-stacking or small team problem solving to relax for a while. As well as this we have a small Git workshop delivered by our GitHub Campus Expert [Lewis Smallwood](https://github.com/LewisSmallwood/).

He will cover how to get Git command-line and Desktop up and running on your system and will cover the basics of source control with Git e.g. creating and linking repositories, adding files to commit and pushing those commits to your repository along with merge/pull to/from repositories.

### Getting started

#### Online tutorials/guides

If you want to start building software and want to try a new language or development framework then the following resources introduce you to Atom and Electron (a customisable editor and a development framework). With these tools you can start exploring the Node.js language:
