# On The Day

## Introduction

This repository will serve as a hub for resources you may utilise for this hackathon. We will be uploading useful tutorials if you want to get started on you projects and any project's you finish at the end of the hackathon can be uploaded here to the repository for your *Show & Tell*!


## Hackathon activities

During the hackathon, there will small activities to take part in i.e. cup-stacking or small team problem solving to relax for a while. As well as this we have a small Git workshop delivered by our GitHub Campus Expert [Lewis Smallwood](https://github.com/LewisSmallwood/).

He will cover how to get Git command-line and Desktop up and running on your system and will cover the basics of source control with Git e.g. creating and linking repositories, adding files to commit and pushing those commits to your repository along with merge/pull to/from repositories.
